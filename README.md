Easily name your controller, model, and service. Let Eman recommend you good names.

## Why?

Well named files help your codebase to become more maintainable in the long run.

## Installation

Install the gem:

    $ gem install eman


## Usage

Simply run the following commands as you see fit:

    $ eman controller
    $ eman model
    $ eman service

Eman will ask you a question or two, and spit out a name, with a further recommendation.
